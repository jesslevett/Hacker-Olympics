        <summary>Cactus Club Cafe</summary>
          <p>Cactus Club Cafe is a chain out of the West Coast that's been in business almost 30 years and has only just landed in Toronto with a new multi-storey, 500-seat restaurant situated in the heart of the Financial District in First Canadian Place.</p>

          <p>The decor is as polished as one might expect from a high budget, corporate-owned restaurant, but one thing I was surprised and delighted to discover was the serious collection of artwork that adorns the walls.</p>

          <p>I was told by a friend of mine that the chain used to be kind of Jack Astors-ish but has since grown up to become something much more accomplished and sophisticated.</p>

          <p>We ordered the butternut squash ravioli with prawns ($25.75). It is certainly a staple and I fully understand why they dare not take it off the menu. The filling is blended with rich and creamy mascarpone and sauced with a truffle-infused beurre blanc.</p>

          <p>Unique to the Toronto location is the Duck Confit ($25 for a single leg, or +$9 two) that sits over a bed of Puy lentils and is served with caramelized pearl onions and a frisase salad. It's a nicely balanced dish complemented by a sweet and tangy gastrique that cuts through the richness of the duck.</p>

        <summary>Rosalinda</summary>
          <p>Rosalinda is a vegan Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Mexican classics are reimagined with vegan ingredients, including tostadas and churros.</p>

          <p>The result of conjoining two business spaces that used to be in this spot, Rosalinda feels like a collection of pockets, with a mix of fake and live plants, a greenhouse-like structure and vintage touches like a chandelier from Smash.</p>

          <p>I had the roasted cauliflower tostada ($7), which is part of a small selection of items on grilled tortillas made with Oaxacan corn. Charred cauliflower provides caramelized earthiness and roughly chopped toasted almonds add crunch, a coriander-based salsa verde and pepita-based sikil pak tying everything together.</p>

          <p>The Rosaburger ($18) sandwiches a patty with a black bean, beet and rice base in a soft Wonderbread bun with shredded iceberg, chipotle mayo, pasilla-based BBQ sauce, avocado salsa, smoked eggplant chips in imitation of bacon and the same gooey vegan mozzarella you’ll find at Libretto. Though you’ll have to spend $20 total for the experience, Rosalinda has been successful in crafting this into a veggie burger that’s somehow simultaneously a spot-on imitation of fast food and in a category all its own — soft, spongy, and saucy yet crispy and crunchy from the lettuce and eggplant chips.</p>

        <summary>Morton's The Steakhouse</summary>
          <p>Ate at Toronto Morton’s this evening... sadly the quality of food has declined significantly.</p>

          <p>Caesar salad was bland, the crab cakes didn’t taste fresh, Brussels sprouts were overcooked. On the upside the filet steak was very good.</p>

          <p>Won’t be returning to Morton’s for a long time. Too bad it used to be a favourite spot to dine.</p>

          <p>Funny, another friend ate at Mortons earlier in the week and had a similar bad experience. He warned me... I should have listened:(</p>
